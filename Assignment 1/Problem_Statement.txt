Data : ODI over-by-over data (04_cricket_1999to2011.csv file):

The data file contains data on ODI matches from 1999 to 2011. It is taken from this site.
There is an R code for finding the 'run production functions' in this(http://eamonmcginn.com.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/) site, 
but you will do something marginally different in the following assignment.

Using the first innings data alone in the above data set, find the best fit 'run production functions' in terms of wickets-in-hand w and overs-to-go u. 
Assume the model Z(u,w) = Z0(w)[1 - exp{-Lu/Z0(w)}]. Use the sum of squared errors loss function, summed across overs, wickets, and data points for those
overs and wickets.

Note that your regression forces all slopes to be equal at u = 0. You should provide a plot of the ten functions, and report the (11) parameters associated 
with the (10) production functions, and the normalised squared error (total squared error summed across overs, wickets, and data points for those overs and 
wickets, and normalised by the total number of data points across all overs and wickets) in your pdf file.

Feel free to use tools for nonlinear regression available in Python. Some date fields are in a different format with an extra comma. 
Write a short script to clean this up. This clean-up code should be a part of the main program. You may create a temporary data file, 
but remove the temporary data file after the output data has been generated.
